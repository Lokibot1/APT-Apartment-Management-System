## 🔗 Backend Integration
The backend logic, including database operations, authentication, and business rules, is handled by a separate developer. This frontend communicates with the backend via pre-defined method calls and form-based event handlers. If you need the backend, please reach out to the project team.

## 🧪 How to Run (Frontend)
1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build the project to restore dependencies.
3. Press `F5` to run the application.
4. Use the forms to simulate UI behavior (no actual database operations unless connected to the backend).
